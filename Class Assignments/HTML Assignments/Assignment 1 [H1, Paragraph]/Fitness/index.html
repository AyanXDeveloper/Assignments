  <h1>Yoga Asanas for Natural PCOD Relief</h1>
  <p>
    Fitness is essential for a healthy body and mind. For women suffering from PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease),
    yoga can offer natural relief. PCOD can cause irregular periods, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances.
    Practicing yoga regularly helps balance hormones, reduce stress, and manage weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some helpful yoga asanas include Butterfly Pose (Baddha Konasana), Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana), and
    Bow Pose (Dhanurasana). These asanas improve blood circulation, stretch the abdominal organs,
    and promote relaxation. Breathing exercises like Pranayama also help calm the nervous system.

  <p>
    Regular yoga practice along with a healthy diet and lifestyle can greatly help women manage PCOD naturally.
